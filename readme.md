## User Stories
- As a user I want to play a game that requires just one repetitive input so that I do not have a steep learning curve or skill barrier to overcome.
- As a user I want to play a game for as long or as little time as I like so that I can enjoy it anytime without having to commit a block of time.
- As a user I want to see what the highest scores achieved are so that I can try and compete against them.
